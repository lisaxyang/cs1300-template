      <h2>Brief Description of Interface:</h2>
      <p>This interface allows users to quickly heat up food. It is adaptable
        to a busy lifestyle because it works effectively on simple foods
        and is generally automated so the user can leave and come back later.
        The interface has a column of buttons that are touchscreen, which 
        control the time and power levels, and a tactile button to open the 
        door in order to put food in and take it out.

    <h1>Observations</h1>
    <div class="container-fluid">
      <h2>User 1:</h2>
      <p>This user uses the number buttons and presses them without much effort;
        they do not try to read the button screens and are holding utensils as 
        they use it. They stop the microwave manually to stir the food, and 
        restart the microwave instead of using the pause button. They press 
        the buttons quickly, jumping directly from the number to start without
        pausing or hovering. They use both plates and wet paper towels to heat
        up their food. They also stop the microwave manually at the end. They do 
        this after they hear popping noises and say "Okay, it sounds done".
        They pull out the food with their hands even though it is evident
        the container is slightly burning them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid">
      <h2>User 2:</h2>
      <p>This user also has something in his hand while interacting with the 
        microwave buttons. While the microwave is going, they are waiting by on
        their phone or filling up the water pitcher. They also leave the kitchen 
        area to go to the bathroom or grab something from their room. They 
        also race back to the microwave to turn it off before the sound goes off.
        They know there is a mute button, but think it is more fun this way.
        They also pull out the food with their hands even though it is evident
        the container is slightly burning them.

    <div class="container-fluid">
      <h2>User 3:</h2>
      <p>This user does not have anything in their hands when using the microwave.
        They are reading the microwave buttons before they press anything, and 
        when the microwave does not start, they spend a minute reading the screen 
        and trying multiple button combinations. They expressed the fact that they 
        were trying to heat it for 1 min 30 seconds, but adding 30 seconds caused
        the microwave pause and they just gave up and went for 1 minute and decided
        to check at the end if the food was warm. They wait by the microwave for it
        to finish, and at the end they check if the food is warm with their hands.

        <h2>User 1:</h2>
        <p>This user wanted to make dinner, and had gotten some corn for this week.
          They expressed that they hoped not to heat up the leftovers wrong and wanted
          it to be even, and hoped not to overdo the corn. They mostly use the 
          buttons: 1, add 30 seconds, cancel. They ignore most of the other buttons.
          The user wished that the microwave could weigh your food and give you
          time estimate or could have more precise power settings, such as a dial.
          This user usually uses the microwave for leftovers from dinner. 
          An ideal meal preparation for the user would be to have vegetables and 
          meat already cooked or somewhat prepared so stir-frying them would be quick. 
        </p>

      <div class="container-fluid">
        <h2>User 2:</h2>
        <p>This user wanted to heat up some water for tea. They expressed that 
          as long as the microwave heats up the food they are okay with it, and 
          that they really don't have much more expectations of the microwave.
          They mostly use the buttons: 1, 2, add 30; they do not touch nor know 
          how the other buttons operate, they added humorously. 
          In using the microwave, they emphasize the importance of beating the 
          microwave to the beep (not letting it go off). 
          They think the microwave is very reliable, and use it to
          heat up food for lunch or dinner when they are too lazy to cook. 
          They also explained that they allow their cooking to be spontaneous
          rather than planning meals ahead of time.

      <div class="container-fluid">
        <h2>User 3:</h2>
        <p>This user wanted to heat up some food for a snack. Although they had 
          a problem with setting the timer for the microwave, they said that they
          strongly agreed that the amount of time it took to heat up their food
          was reasonable. 
          This user only uses the number buttons and does not touch any of the 
          specialty buttons, and says a microwave without them would be acceptable.
          When heating something up, they expressed an intention to continue
          monitoring the food in the microwave to make sure nothing goes wrong. 
          The user, however, was confused why when trying to set the button 
          the microwave somehow went to the clock settings.
          This user uses the microwave mostly for microwavable meals, as opposed
          to heating up leftovers.
          An ideal meal preparation for this user is a meal that requires no preparation.

      <h2>Nervous Natalie</h2>

      <p>Nervous Natalie is a perfectionist college student. She is trying to make another meal for dinner and bought something she doesn’t cook as often.
        Natalie isn’t prone to taking risks because she needs to feel in control of the situation. This means that she usually feels a need to stand by the microwave to monitor it even though it automatically shuts off. She also does not explore or utilize the options on the microwave because she is afraid that something might go wrong.
        This persona represents some college students who are already very strung out by school. They have always felt the need to be high achieving and live up to some standard, and of course that is not always possible. Therefore, this perfectionism leaks into other aspects of their life, such as food preparation.
        Like most college students, Natalie will probably need to use the microwave in her dorm from time to time to make food, and there are typically perfectionist-personality type people in high-achieving schools.

      <h2>Silly Simon</h2>

      <p>Silly Simon loves to make jokes and loves his friends. He is just making another late night snack while zooming with his friends.
        Simon’s love of making jokes means he doesn’t really take the microwave seriously. He doesn’t use it to its full potential because he thinks it’s funny to race the microwave and to not understand how it works fully. As long as he has edible food, Simon doesn’t really care about his microwave or what else it can do.
        This persona represents some college students who feel a very strong need to be liked. They therefore allow themselves to be the butt of jokes and do not always take themselves very seriously. 
        Like most college students, Simon will probably need to use the microwave in his dorm from time to time to make food, and many college students also may feel a need to fit in and long for belonging.
