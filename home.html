    <h5>This project explores how personas are used in UI design.
      A public interface is chosen in order to practice observations and interviews.
      From the gathered data, possible personas are drafted, and a storyboard 
      is created to depict the persona interaction with the interface.
      <br>
      I hope you enjoy reading it; a lot of love was put into this piece. &#128522;

            <h2>Brief Description of Interface:</h2>
            <p>This interface allows users to quickly heat up food. It is adaptable
              to a busy lifestyle because it works effectively on simple foods
              and is generally automated so the user can leave and come back later.
              The interface has a column of buttons that are touchscreen, which 
              control the time and power levels, and a tactile button to open the 
              door in order to put food in and take it out.

            <h2>Notes:</h2>
            <p>While sketching the interface, I wondered if the button to open
              the door would be problematic. It seemed that it could be a problem 
              if you were holding something in your hand or that maybe over time 
              the button wouldn't press as smoothly. 
              I also noticed that the buttons were mostly touchscreen, and I 
              noted that this would probably be important to make the interface
              more resistant to damage when exposed to so much food.

          <p>This user uses the number buttons and presses them without much effort;
            they do not try to read the button screens and are holding utensils as 
            they use it. They stop the microwave manually to stir the food, and 
            restart the microwave instead of using the pause button. They press 
            the buttons quickly, jumping directly from the number to start without
            pausing or hovering. They use both plates and wet paper towels to heat
            up their food. They also stop the microwave manually at the end. They do 
            this after they hear popping noises and say "Okay, it sounds done".
            They pull out the food with their hands even though it is evident
            the container is slightly burning them.

          <p>This user also has something in his hand while interacting with the 
            microwave buttons. While the microwave is going, they are waiting by on
            their phone or filling up the water pitcher. They also leave the kitchen 
            area to go to the bathroom or grab something from their room. They 
            also race back to the microwave to turn it off before the sound goes off.
            They know there is a mute button, but think it is more fun this way.
            They also pull out the food with their hands even though it is evident
            the container is slightly burning them.

          <p>This user does not have anything in their hands when using the microwave.
            They are reading the microwave buttons before they press anything, and 
            when the microwave does not start, they spend a minute reading the screen 
            and trying multiple button combinations. They expressed the fact that they 
            were trying to heat it for 1 min 30 seconds, but adding 30 seconds caused
            the microwave pause and they just gave up and went for 1 minute and decided
            to check at the end if the food was warm. They wait by the microwave for it
            to finish, and at the end they check if the food is warm with their hands.

          <h2>Notes:</h2>
          <p>I noticed that the button seemed easier to press than I thought, 
            because two of the users were holding things in their hand 
            (albeit light things) while pressing the button. 
            It was also interesting to see that users would use sounds to 
            check when to take out the food, or what they would do while 
            waiting for the food. These things seemed related to how comfortable
            and experienced they were with the microwave.

          <h2>User 1:</h2>
          <p>This user wanted to make dinner, and had gotten some corn for this week.
            They expressed that they hoped not to heat up the leftovers wrong and wanted
            it to be even, and hoped not to overdo the corn. They mostly use the 
            buttons: 1, add 30 seconds, cancel. They ignore most of the other buttons.
            The user wished that the microwave could weigh your food and give you
            time estimate or could have more precise power settings, such as a dial.
            This user usually uses the microwave for leftovers from dinner. 
            An ideal meal preparation for the user would be to have vegetables and 
            meat already cooked or somewhat prepared so stir-frying them would be quick.

          <p>This user wanted to heat up some water for tea. They expressed that 
            as long as the microwave heats up the food they are okay with it, and 
            that they really don't have much more expectations of the microwave.
            They mostly use the buttons: 1, 2, add 30; they do not touch nor know 
            how the other buttons operate, they added humorously. 
            In using the microwave, they emphasize the importance of beating the 
            microwave to the beep (not letting it go off). 
            They think the microwave is very reliable, and use it to
            heat up food for lunch or dinner when they are too lazy to cook. 
            They also explained that they allow their cooking to be spontaneous
            rather than planning meals ahead of time.

          <h2>User 3:</h2>
          <p>This user wanted to heat up some food for a snack. Although they had 
            a problem with setting the timer for the microwave, they said that they
            strongly agreed that the amount of time it took to heat up their food
            was reasonable. 
            This user only uses the number buttons and does not touch any of the 
            specialty buttons, and says a microwave without them would be acceptable.
            When heating something up, they expressed an intention to continue
            monitoring the food in the microwave to make sure nothing goes wrong. 
            The user, however, was confused why when trying to set the button 
            the microwave somehow went to the clock settings.
            This user uses the microwave mostly for microwavable meals, as opposed
            to heating up leftovers.
            An ideal meal preparation for this user is a meal that requires no preparation.

        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <p>It seems like all the users agreed on mostly using just the number 
          buttons in the microwave, even though they all had varying levels 
          of experience with the microwave. It makes me wonder what type of 
          users the other buttons are geared towards. 
          Asking about what the users wished a microwave could do was a very
          enlightening question that I feel revealed not only how the user 
          thinks about a microwave but also about their motivations and goals 
          more than direct questions would.

          <p>Nervous Natalie is a perfectionist college student. She is trying to make another meal for dinner and bought something she doesnâ€™t cook as often.
            Natalie isnâ€™t prone to taking risks because she needs to feel in control of the situation. This means that she usually feels a need to stand by the microwave to monitor it even though it automatically shuts off. She also does not explore or utilize the options on the microwave because she is afraid that something might go wrong.
            <br><br>
            This persona represents some college students who are already very strung out by school. They have always felt the need to be high achieving and live up to some standard, and of course that is not always possible. Therefore, this perfectionism leaks into other aspects of their life, such as food preparation.
            Like most college students, Natalie will probably need to use the microwave in her dorm from time to time to make food, and there are typically perfectionist-personality type people in high-achieving schools.

        <p>Silly Simon loves to make jokes and loves his friends. He is just making another late night snack while zooming with his friends.
          Simonâ€™s love of making jokes means he doesnâ€™t really take the microwave seriously. He doesnâ€™t use it to its full potential because he thinks itâ€™s funny to race the microwave and to not understand how it works fully. As long as he has edible food, Simon doesnâ€™t really care about his microwave or what else it can do.

          This persona represents some college students who feel a very strong need to be liked. They therefore allow themselves to be the butt of jokes and do not always take themselves very seriously.

    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p>In buildling the personas and the storyboard, it was most helpful to focus
      on what responses made each persona unique. This usually meant that what 
      was most helpful were the conversations or answers that I was not expecting. 
      For example, being able to understand the user's motivation and concept of
      the microwave through the question "Do you wish there was something the microwave could do that it canâ€™t right now?"
      was incredibly helpful in building the goals and feelings of the personas.
      In the end, building a consistent persona with focused yet clear goals 
      informed the creation of the final storyboard.
